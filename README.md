SpringBoot-Test-Basic
This project is the part of exploring the Spring TestContext Framework.
I would appreciate  if anyone of you help me to better understand the Spring TestContext Framework, 
As I have wriiten some sample test casess at repository level,service level and Integration level by leveraging the 
spring-boot-starter and junit 4.
If that test cases can be wriiten in more efficient and elegant manner than kindly tell me, or you can create a branch of it and add those changes into that.
Thanks.
